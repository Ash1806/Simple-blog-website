		At face value and viewing life through the brainwashed society we are all born into, the answer may sound rather obvious, we need to earn money to purchase material objects in order to survive. For most that makes sense and needs no further questioning. However, one must ask in a world which fundamentally has enough natural resources to feed clothe and house every single person why there is such a work ethos.

We are led to believe that we are running out of resources and the world is overpopulated when, in fact, the reality is completely the reverse. If we were to gather every man, woman and child and moved them to Australia, the whole world population would fit comfortably within the country. Each family having their own house and garden and that would still only fill 3/4 of the land mass
